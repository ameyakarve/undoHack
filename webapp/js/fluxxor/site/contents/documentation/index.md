Documentation
=============

Fluxxor consists of three core pieces:

* [Fluxxor.Flux](/documentation/flux.html)
* [Stores](/documentation/stores.html)
* [Actions](/documentation/actions.html)

Additionally, Fluxxor ships with some mixins to make it easier to use in conjunction with React:</p>

* [Fluxxor.FluxMixin](/documentation/flux-mixin.html)
* [Fluxxor.StoreWatchMixin](/documentation/store-watch-mixin.html)

For installation instructions, see the [installation](/getting-started/installation.html) page. Be sure to check out the [quick-start guide](/getting-started/quick-start.html) and the [examples](/examples/), too!
