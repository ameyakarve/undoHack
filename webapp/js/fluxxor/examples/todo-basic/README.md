Basic Todos Example
===================

This is a very, very simple todo app. The Fluxxor website builds this app step by step in [the quick-start guide](http://fluxxor.com/getting-started/quick-start.html).

To run, simply open `app/index.html` in your web browserâ€”`index.html` and `bundle.js` are the only files required to run the application (`bundle.js` is build with [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)). If you want to modify the source and see your updates, run `./start.sh` and point your browser to `http://localhost:8089/index.html` (you will need to install the `devDependencies` from the root of the Fluxxor project first).
